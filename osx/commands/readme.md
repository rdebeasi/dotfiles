# Commands

These files make it easy to launch command-line apps from spotlight. To use them:

- Run `chmod +x` on each command to make it executable.
- Update `pugdebug.command` to point to your copy of pugdebug.
- Configure terminal to [close if the shell exited cleanly](http://superuser.com/a/158376/284351) so you don't have an extra terminal window hanging around after the command runs.
- Type `pugdebug.command` or even just `pugdebug.com` into spotlight to launch the app!
